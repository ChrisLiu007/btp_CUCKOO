# btp_CUCKOO
Optimisation of Analog Circuits Using Cuckoo Search Algorithm And Firefly Algorithm


>Cuckootemp:Main MATLAB Code for Optimisation

>modfir: Matlab Code for Firefly algo.

>temp.cir and temp.spi are circuit design files[can also use cmosota_apr2018.cir(make sure to change in MATLAB too)]

>dump_txt:Dump file from ELDO via Mentor Grap.

>width.txt :final width of the mosfets for which tests were performed.

>cuckootemp: Matlab code for cuckoo search optimisation Algo [Better than firefly].
